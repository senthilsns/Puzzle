 Given two sorted arrays of integers, find the median

 Example: _nums1: [1,3,5]
 
 Example: _nums2: [2,4,6]
 
 Median -> 3.5
 
 Explanation: After merging, and then SORTING two arrays we get: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 
 Middle two elements are [3,4]. Take average of those: (3+4) / 2 = 3.5
 
 This is for an array that is even. Now for an odd array:
 
 Example: _nums1: [-1,3,5]
 
 Example: _nums2: [0,2]
 
 Median -> 2
 
 Explanation: After merging two arrays we get [-1,0,2,3,5]
 
 Middle of this is 2.
